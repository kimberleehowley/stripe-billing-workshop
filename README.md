# Stripe Billing Workshop creating subsciptions

This workshop is designed to get developers started on Stripe Billing. During the workshop, weâ€™ll build a sample web application, create a flat-rate subscription, and setup payment details for recurring billing.  

  

## Pre-requisites: 
1. If you donâ€™t have one, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register)
2. Clone this repo 
```
git clone git@github.com:ctrudeau-stripe/stripe-billing-workshop.git
```
3. Copy the environment variables file from the root of the repository: `cp .env.example .env`
4. Get your public and secret **test** keys from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys) and put them in the newly created `.env` file.
5. Open the [creating subscriptions guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/creating-subscriptions) that this workshop follows 
6. [optional] [Install the Stripe CLI to support webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli)

## How to run locally

Weâ€™ll run and serve the application at: http://localhost:4242.

This sample includes [5 server implementations](server/README.md) in our most popular languages.

If you want to run the sample locally, copy the .env.example file to your own .env file in this directory:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need a Stripe account with its own set of [API keys](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys).

## FAQ

Q: Why did you pick these frameworks?

A: We chose the most minimal framework to convey the key Stripe calls and concepts you need to understand. These demos are meant as an educational tool that helps you roadmap how to integrate Stripe within your own system independent of the framework.

Q: Can you show me how to build X?

A: We are always looking for new sample ideas, please email dev-samples@stripe.com with your suggestion!
