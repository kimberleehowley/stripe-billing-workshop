# Stripe Billing Workshop creating subsciptions

This workshop is designed to get developers started on Stripe Billing. During the workshop, weâ€™ll build a sample web application, create a flat-rate subscription, and setup payment details for recurring billing.

5. Open the [creating subscriptions guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/creating-subscriptions) that this workshop follows

### If you get stuck you can find a fully implemented server on the [workshop answers branch](https://github.com/ctrudeau-stripe/stripe-billing-workshop/tree/workshop-answers). Search the project for Step 1-7 to see the code from the guide implemented.

## How to run locally

Weâ€™ll run and serve the application at: http://localhost:4242.

This sample includes [5 server implementations](server/README.md) in our most popular languages.

If you want to run the sample locally, copy the .env.example file to your own .env file in this directory:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need a Stripe account with its own set of [API keys](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys).
